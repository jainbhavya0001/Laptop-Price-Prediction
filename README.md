# Laptop-Price-Prediction
This is a project where I have used multiple Machine learning models to predict the price of laptop given various features/specifications like Ram, Weight, Storage,Type of Processor,etc.

Then using Correlational Analysis and selecting particular features a machine learning model is developed and R2 score is calculated by minimizing the error.

Model used for analysis - **Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest.**

**Result:**

**R2 score->**

(i) Linear regression = 0.807

(ii) KNN = 0.802

(iii) Decision Tree = 0.848

(iv) Random Forest = 0.887

**Mean absolute error->**

(i) Linear regression = 0.210

(ii) KNN = 0.193

(iii) Decision Tree = 0.178

(iv) Random Forest = 0.158

So, Random Forest classification is best suited for Laptop price prediction as it has maximum R2 score and least mean absolute error.
